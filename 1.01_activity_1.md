Try to answer these questions:

1. What is the difference between list and tuple?
2. What is the difference between `for` loop and `while` loop?
3. What are the conditional statements in Python?


1. A list is mutable whereas a tuple is immutable 
2. Initialization, condition checking, iteration statement are written at the top of the loop in a 'for' loop statement whereas in a 'while' loop	only initialization and condition checking is done at the top of the loop.
3. If, else and elif.
